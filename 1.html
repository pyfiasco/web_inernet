        This page gives some rough guidelines which most Wikipedia editors use to decide if a form of web-specific content, being either the content of a website or the specific website itself, should have an article on Wikipedia. Web content includes, but is not limited to, blogs, Internet forums, newsgroups, online magazines, other media, podcasts, webcomics, and web portals. Any content accessed via the internet and engaged with primarily through a web browser is considered web content for the purposes of this guideline.[1]

    <p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
        objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured
        documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other
        items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
